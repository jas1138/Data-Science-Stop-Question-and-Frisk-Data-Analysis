# Data-Science-Stop-Question-and-Frisk-Data-Analysis
This is a repository that includes my R code, other sources I used (particularly Census data for NYC in 2010 and 2020), and a copy of my paper to this repository. 
I also utilized a csv file that consisted of data from New York City's Stop, Question, and Frisk program for the years 2011 and 2018, but I was unable to upload the file becasue it was too large. However, the data is freely accessible by completing a search online for the Stop, Question, and Frisk data for those years.
